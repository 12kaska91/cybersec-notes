Difficulty: Medium

Extract the strings zip file with the password (MalwareTech) and import it to ghidra.
Read `md5_hash(PTR_s_FLAG{CAN-I-MAKE-IT-ANYMORE-OBVIO_00432294)` in `void entry(void)`.
"PTR_s_" comes from ghdira -> FLAG{CAN-I-MAKE-IT-ANYMORE-OBVIO_00432294
Should mean FLAG{CAN-I-MAKE-IT-ANYMORE-OBVIOUS} then.

Second task was pretty much the same.
Read `builtin_strncpy(local_2c,"FLAG{STACK-STRINGS-ARE-BEST-STRINGS}",0x24);`
and submit FLAG{STACK-STRINGS-ARE-BEST-STRINGS} as it is clear text now

Now onto the third task.
The answer lies in: `LoadStringA((HINSTANCE)0x0,0x110,&local_4a4,0x3ff);`
It searches the 272nd entry in rc.rc where you will find the flag:
`FLAG{RESOURCES-ARE-POPULAR-FOR-MALWARE}`
